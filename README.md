# LendigoNews
An app that reads news from API in realtime 

# Problem Description

The goal is to make a react native app (android) to make it easier to navigate the news: Using the endpoints found here https://hackernews.api-docs.io. 

# Implementation:

Display a selection of the latest top stories;
Scroll down to reload and get newer stories;
As there are many stories, you probably want to use pagination or lazy loading when you display them.
 

# The app should also have:

A welcome splash screen;
A login/registration screen that uses a local SQLite database;
An about screen with information about you;
A navigation system that can jump between screens.

# Bonus

Use Redux for managing the app state;
Use react-native-web and react-native-paper;
Be creative! :)
